    description: "Yes, I admit it - Jonathan Higbee and I are friends. I say this upfront because likely someone will point it out. However, what people likely don't know is that Jonathan's photography was what attracted me initially. His work is good in a way that I cannot quite put my finger on."

    description: "There are 49 portraits in Bruce Gilden's new book, Face, published this month by Dewi Lewis, and it's a safe bet you'll probably remember all of them. That's partly due to Gilden's raw approach to street photography, a stark, in-your-face style; and partly due to his subjects, a mix of \"characters\" as he calls..."

    description: "With how it's portrayed in pop culture, why would anyone want to be a ballet dancer? Black Swan likened it to a dark, chaotic underworld; Center Stage to a cesspool of egoists and mean girls; and even the \"reality\" show Breaking Pointe made it seem like a bizarre version of The Dating Game in pointe shoes."

    description: 'One of my past jobs was that of college professor. My favorite (and first) class I ever taught was Digital Imaging Essentials... which was essentially how to really know what was going on with photographic files. Each semester, a bunch of students would try to test out of the class.'
