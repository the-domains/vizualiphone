title: "This little one isn't so little anymore. As a baby @jsw2002 we would call her tulip...not sure why. But when I look at tulips I smile. Maybe it's because living in the Midwest signs of tulips mean new life is about to begin. Sophie has a personality that makes me and Julia smile. I really hate seeing her get older I must admit."
