    description: "Chinese smartphone giant Huawei has tried, for years, to create a compelling global flagship smartphone. Its phones often have great specifications, solid pricing and pleasant (though never very original) design, but none of them manage to wow consumers outside of China the way Apple's iPhone or Samsung's Galaxy smartphones do."

Samsung phones thoroughly dominate the Android space, so you have to share a veritable LG origin story whenever explaining an LG phone to non-nerd looky-loos.
