![I am playing this game with some friends ‪#‎WhereAmI All shot with iPhone6+ with either a 60mm @moment_lens and @olloclip macro and edited on the iPhone as well. All images are part of my weekly routine called ‪#‎walkabouts‬ which I post to my IG account every week. Why I made these images...I am focusing most of my photographic work these days to tourism companies for example @airbnb, wine and travel magazines. All images were taken where we call home these days Healdsburg,CA. If anyone is interested in the Moments Lens let me know I have a discount code. It's a really nice piece of glass and a lot of fun. My friends @garethpon and @colerise have inspired me a great deal with these lenses.](https://igcdn-photos-d-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xaf1/t51.2885-15/1389282_1462989447337643_491732110_n.jpg)
